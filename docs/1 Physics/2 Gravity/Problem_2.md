# Problem 2

## Escape Velocities and Cosmic Velocities

### Motivation
Understanding escape velocity is crucial for space exploration. The first, second, and third cosmic velocities define the speed needed to:

* Stay in orbit (first cosmic velocity).
* Escape a planet’s gravity (second cosmic velocity).
* Leave a star system (third cosmic velocity).
These concepts are fundamental for launching satellites, interplanetary travel, and deep-space missions.

## Cosmic Velocities Definitions
### First Cosmic Velocity (Orbital Velocity)
The minimum speed required to stay in a circular orbit around a planet. Derived from:

$v1\=RGM​$​


### Second Cosmic Velocity (Escape Velocity)
The speed needed to break free from a planet’s gravity without further propulsion.
 
​“v2​\=2​⋅v1​\=R2GM​​”

Third Cosmic Velocity (Interstellar Escape)
The velocity required to leave the Sun’s gravitational influence:

𝑣“v3​\=2​⋅dGM⊙​​​”

where $M ⊙$ is the Sun’s mass and $𝑑$ is the distance from the Sun.

(Include a velocity vs. planet graph from the Jupyter Notebook output.)

## Importance in Space Exploration
Satellites: Need at least the first cosmic velocity.
Moon & Mars Missions: Require second cosmic velocity to leave Earth.
Interstellar Travel: Future missions must reach the third cosmic velocity.
### Conclusion
Understanding cosmic velocities is key to space travel. With this knowledge, we can design better rockets, plan efficient space missions, and explore beyond our solar system.
