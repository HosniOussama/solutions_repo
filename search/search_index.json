This study explores how the range of a projectile depends on its launch angle, uncovering both theoretical and computational insights. Theoretical Foundation The motion of a projectile follows these kinematic equations: Horizontal motion: \\(x = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) t\\) Vertical motion: \\(y = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2\\) Time of flight: \\(T = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g}\\) Range equation: \\(R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g}\\) Python Simulation import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt g = 9.81 # gravitational acceleration (m/s^2) v0 = 20 # initial velocity (m/s) theta = np.linspace(0, np.pi/2, 100) R = (v0**2 * np.sin(2*theta)) / g plt.plot(np.degrees(theta), R) plt.xlabel(\"Launch Angle (degrees)\") plt.ylabel(\"Range (m)\") plt.title(\"Projectile Range vs. Launch Angle\") plt.grid() plt.show() Investigating the Dynamics of a Forced Damped Pendulum Motivation The forced damped pendulum exhibits complex behaviors such as resonance and chaos.
